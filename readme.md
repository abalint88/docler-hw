# Docler Homework - ES6 coding test - Chat app

## ES6 Coding Test

Create a chat application in ES6 with socket.io.

### Description:

It’s a socket.io based chat interface. When the user opens the application, he meets this view. It contains a chat message box, where the sent messages are floating right and the received messages are floating left. One row contains the text of the message and also the nickname if it is not the current user. There is an input, where you can set the current user’s nickname. Next to it a text input field and a send button at the end.

You must not use any 3rd party framework or code other than the [socket.io](socket.io) client. It should work in the latest chrome without transpiling, you shouldn’t bundle anything. It has to have “brutalist” design.
* Socket.io server address: [http://185.13.90.140:8081/](http://185.13.90.140:8081/)
* Socket.io version: 2.2.0

You should listen to event message, and you should trigger the event message also. The example data is ``` { message: ‘Hi’, user: ‘guest0001’ } ```

You should commit your code to GitHub and provide the repository url.

Good luck!

## Formatting

I used two spaced simple tabs for spacing. This is just a personal preference for more compact view.

## Prerequisites

* Newest chrome browser.
* Internet connection.

## Installing

There is nothing to install as requested. The used [socklet.io](socklet.io) client js file is included, but nothing else is needed. Open the file in the newsest chrome and enjoy.
